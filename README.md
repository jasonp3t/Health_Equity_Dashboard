# Health_Equity_Dashboard
### *An Intersectional Approach to Identifying Vertical Equity Gaps*

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Health Equity Insights Platform** is a strategic diagnostic tool designed to analyze healthcare expenditure through a multi-dimensional lens. By intersecting clinical encounter data with socio-economic indicators—such as **Income (Wealth)**, **Race/Ethnicity**, **Gender**, and **Age**—the platform identifies specific "Critical Cohorts" that face disproportionate financial burdens.

Our goal is to move beyond simple averages and uncover the **intersectional realities** of healthcare access and cost-impact to inform better policy and resource allocation.

## 🎯 Key Research Questions
1. **Vertical Equity:** How does the financial burden of healthcare scale across different income tiers?
2. **Intersectionality:** How do gender and race exacerbate the cost-impact of specific chronic conditions?
3. **Geographic Intensity:** Which regions demonstrate the highest clinical costs when filtered for underserved demographics?
4. **Coverage Sufficiency:** Is existing insurance coverage adequate for the most expensive clinical conditions?
